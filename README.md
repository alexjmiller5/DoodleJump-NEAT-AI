# TODO:

- Make sure that the doodler always has a platform that is reachable
- make the gravity and bounce scale correctly so that the game gets more difficult
- create a starting screen button
- make sure that the doodler's sideswitching doesn't affect the collision detection
- make the doodler be able to switch sides of the screen from the edge
